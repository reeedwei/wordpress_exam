== Description ==
Asteroid is a simple, clean and responsive WordPress theme. It incorporates various widget areas 
that make management of banners and ads a lot easier, especially for ad-supported sites. 
The theme is ideal for use on a blog, a static website or both. It has an intuitively designed 
options panel to help customize your site. The theme’s development focuses on user customization 
and minimizing HTTP requests to help conserve server resource. Asteroid supports RTL Languages,
custom header images, backgrounds, menus, full-width page templates, basic schema.org markup and more.
Compatible with ClassicPress.
