The plan followed in the present article is primarily chronological, tracing the development of technology through phases that succeed each other in time. Obviously, the division between phases is to a large extent arbitrary. One factor in the weighting has been the enormous acceleration of Western technological development in recent centuries; Eastern technology is considered in this article in the main only as it relates to the development of modern technology.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-verse\" style=\"font-size:15px\">Within each chronological phase a standard method has been adopted for&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/technology\/surveying\">surveying<\/a>&nbsp;the technological experience and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/innovations\">innovations<\/a>. This begins with a brief review of the general social conditions of the period under discussion, and then goes on to consider the dominant materials and sources of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/science\/power-physics\">power<\/a>&nbsp;of the period, and their application to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/topic\/food\">food<\/a>&nbsp;production,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/technology\/manufacturing\">manufacturing<\/a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/technology\/industry\">industry<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/technology\/construction\">building construction<\/a>, transport and communications,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/technology\/military-technology\">military technology<\/a>, and medical technology. In a final section the sociocultural consequences of technological change in the period are examined. This framework is modified according to the particular requirements of every period\u2014 discussions of new materials, for instance, occupy a substantial place in the accounts of earlier phases when new metals were being introduced but are comparatively unimportant in descriptions of some of the later phases\u2014but the general pattern is retained throughout. One key factor that does not fit easily into this pattern is that of the development of tools. It has seemed most convenient to relate these to the study of materials, rather than to any particular application, but it has not been possible to be completely consistent in this treatment. Further discussion of specific areas of technological development is provided in a variety of other articles: for example,&nbsp;<em>see<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/technology\/electronics\"> <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/technology\/electronics\">electronics<\/a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/topic\/Earth-exploration\">exploration<\/a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/technology\/information-processing\">information processing<\/a>.<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Technology Timeline &#8217;90s &#8211; Present<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul style=\"font-size:15px\"><li>1901: Radio<\/li><li>1903: Airplane<\/li><li>1926: Rocketry<\/li><li>1927: Television<\/li><li>1937: Computer<\/li><li>1942: Nuclear power<\/li><li>1947: Transistor<\/li><li>1957: Spaceflight<\/li><li>1974: Personal computer<\/li><li>1974: Internet<\/li><li>2012: CRISPR<\/li><li>2017: Artificial intelligence<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">In comparison, technology has often been understood as the &#8220;systematic knowledge of the industrial arts.&#8221; As this knowledge was implemented by means of techniques, technology has become commonly taken to mean both the knowledge and the means of its utilization, that is, \u201ca body of knowledge about techniques.&#8221; Modern technology also involves systematic research, but its outcome is more concrete than science, i.e., the production of &#8220;a thing, a chemical, a process, something to be bought and sold.&#8221; In the past, science and technology developed separately, with the latter being largely a product of trial and error in response to a particular human need. In modern times, however, the progress of science and technology has become intimately linked together. Many scientific discoveries have been facilitated by the development of new technology. New scientific knowledge has often led to further refinement of existing technology or the invention of entirely new ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3>General considerations<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\" style=\"font-size:15px\"><code>Essentially, techniques are methods of creating new&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/technology\/tool\">tools<\/a>&nbsp;and products of tools, and the capacity for constructing such&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/artifacts\">artifacts<\/a>&nbsp;is a determining characteristic of humanlike species. Other species make artifacts:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/animal\/bee\">bees<\/a>&nbsp;build elaborate hives to deposit their honey,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/animal\/bird-animal\">birds<\/a>&nbsp;make nests, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/animal\/beaver\">beavers<\/a>&nbsp;build dams. But these attributes are the result of patterns of instinctive behaviour and cannot be varied to suit rapidly changing circumstances. Human beings, in contrast to other species, do not possess highly developed instinctive reactions but do have the capacity to think systematically and creatively about techniques. Humans can thus innovate and consciously modify the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/environment\">environment<\/a>&nbsp;in a way no other species has achieved. An ape may on occasion use a stick to beat bananas from a tree, but a person can fashion the stick into a cutting&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/technology\/tool\">tool<\/a>&nbsp;and remove a whole bunch of bananas. Somewhere in the transition between the two, the hominid, the first humanlike species, emerges. By virtue of humanity\u2019s nature as a toolmaker, humans have therefore been technologists from the beginning, and the history of technology&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/encompasses\">encompasses<\/a>&nbsp;the whole evolution of humankind.<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"\/>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The need to develop a country&#8217;s science and technology has generally been recognized as one of the imperatives of socioeconomic progress in the contemporary world.
